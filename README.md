# Transmission Line Fault Detection with YOLOv8

 Detecting defects in transmission line insulators using deep learning and computer vision.


## Overview

This project uses [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) (Ultralytics) to identify faults in transmission line insulators. It uses a labeled dataset from Roboflow and runs in Google Colab for fast prototyping and training.

>  Built with PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLOv8, Roboflow, and Google Colab.
